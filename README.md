# AI-Based-Detection-of-Depression-Risk-Through-Lifestyle-and-Psychological-Data
The project aims to demonstrate the potential of AI in mental health diagnostics. ðŸš€

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Utilizes SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements logistic regression for binary classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Provides key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-depression-risk-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-depression-risk-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure the dataset is in the expected format.
   - Update the file path in the code to point to your dataset.

2. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook AI_Powered_Detection_of_Depression_Risk_Through_Lifestyle_and_Psychological_Data.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## File Structure

- **AI_Powered_Detection_of_Depression_Risk_Through_Lifestyle_and_Psychological_Data.ipynb**: Main notebook containing all code and analysis.
